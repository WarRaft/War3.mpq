# Introduction

<!-- 1.0 -->

An important word ahead.
The information in this document is addressed to developers who want to create
programs, tools and websites that help to enrich the gaming experience for the
*whole* WarCraft III community.
We absolutely do not tolerate hacks and cheats. Therefore you MUST NOT use
the information provided in this document for any of these purposes.

This file is meant to contain a description of the replay format itself.
Additional notes and explanations on single fields and/or algorithms will
(eventually) be moved to a seperate file `w3g_notes.txt` some day.

The whole file is still under construction. The meaning of some fields is still
unknown and "known" fields might be wrong. Please contact us if you figure out
any unknown values or find a replay that simply does not conform with the
description of a "known" field.

## Convention

Sections directly related to data stored in the replay file are written in
square brackets `[]`.
