00:00:21:11	00:00:25:19	We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies.
00:00:29:00	00:00:33:06	Like fools we clung to the old hatreds
00:00:37:05	00:00:40:21	and fought as we had for generations
00:01:11:03	00:01:15:10	until the day the sky rained fire
00:01:15:10	00:01:18:02	and a new enemy came upon us.
00:01:49:14	00:01:55:04	We stand now upon the brink of destruction,
00:01:55:08	00:02:01:00	for the Reign of Chaos has come at last.
