00:00:09:18	00:00:14:02	Let this scar signify the first blow against the mortal world. 
00:00:29:22	00:00:33:23	From this seal shall arise the doom of men, 
00:00:35:10	00:00:39:08	who, in their arrogance,<p> sought to wield our fire as their own. 
00:00:41:07	00:00:45:20	Blindly they built their kingdoms<p> upon stolen knowledge and conceit. 
00:00:49:21	00:00:58:22	Now they shall be consumed by<p> the very flame they sought to control. 
00:01:51:02	00:01:58:14	Let the echoes of doom resound across this wretched world,<p> that all who live may hear them and despair.
