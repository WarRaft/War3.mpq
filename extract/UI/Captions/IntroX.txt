00:00:10:23	00:00:13:11	Betrayer
00:00:15:03	00:00:20:00	In truth, it was I who was betrayed.
00:00:28:20	00:00:31:22	Still I am hunted.
00:00:33:17	00:00:36:15	Still I am hated.
00:00:38:15	00:00:43:00	Now, my blind eyes see what others cannot.
00:00:50:00	00:00:55:29	That sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.
00:02:42:20	00:02:45:13	Now, go forth.
00:02:48:20	00:02:52:06	Unleash the tides of doom.
00:02:55:02	00:02:57:15	Upon all those 
00:02:58:11	00:03:00:20	who would oppose us.
