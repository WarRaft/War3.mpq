00:01:25:04	00:01:27:09	Ah, my son. 
00:01:28:01	00:01:33:08	You no longer need to sacrifice for your people. 
00:01:33:09	00:01:38:17	You no longer need to bear the weight of your crown. 
00:01:38:18	00:01:43:09	I've taken care of everything. 
00:01:56:11	00:02:00:11	What is this? What are you doing, my son? 
00:02:00:12	00:02:03:19	Succeeding you, Father... 
00:02:15:09	00:02:17:22	This kingdom shall fall, 
00:02:19:07	00:02:23:00	and from the ashes shall arise a new order 
00:02:23:06	00:02:28:14	that will shake the very foundations of the world.
